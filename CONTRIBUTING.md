# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to ZapCmd. This guide focuses on the local + CI quality gates so your PR is easy to review and merge.

## Quick Start

1) Install dependencies:

`npm install`

2) Run the desktop app in dev:

`npm run tauri:dev`

3) (Recommended) Enable repo Git hooks:

`node scripts/setup-githooks.mjs`

4) Before opening a PR, run the full quality gate:

`npm run check:all`

## Command Cheat Sheet

| What you want | Command |
|---|---|
| Install dependencies | `npm install` |
| Enable repo Git hooks (recommended once) | `node scripts/setup-githooks.mjs` |
| Check if hooks are enabled | `git config core.hooksPath` |
| Run the same logic as pre-commit (reads staged files) | `npm run precommit:guard` |
| Run the full merge gate (same bar as CI) | `npm run check:all` |
| One-command local full validation (quality gate + Windows desktop smoke; Windows auto-installs missing WebDriver deps) | `npm run verify:local` |
| Run desktop dev | `npm run tauri:dev` |
| Run tests (no coverage) | `npm run test:run` |
| Run tests with coverage (gate) | `npm run test:coverage` |
| Regenerate builtin commands (PowerShell) | `pwsh -File scripts/generate_builtin_commands.ps1` |
| Windows desktop E2E smoke (same as CI) | `npm run e2e:desktop:smoke` |

Note: `npm install` runs `package.json#prepare` which attempts to enable hooks automatically. If you use `--ignore-scripts`, run `node scripts/setup-githooks.mjs` manually.

## Local pre-commit gate

If `git config core.hooksPath` is set to `.githooks`, every `git commit` runs:

`.githooks/pre-commit` → `npm run precommit:guard` → `scripts/precommit-guard.mjs`

You can also run it manually:

`npm run precommit:guard`

Note: `git commit --no-verify` skips hooks (CI will still enforce gates).

If you want to disable hooks locally (not recommended):

`git config --unset core.hooksPath`

Verify (expect no output):

`git config --get core.hooksPath`

## Coverage failures: how to debug (`npm run test:coverage` output)

In this repo, `test:coverage` is a wrapper (see `scripts/coverage/run-test-coverage.mjs`) that:

1) Runs `vitest run --coverage`  
2) **Always** attempts to print actionable coverage diagnostics afterwards (see `scripts/coverage/coverage-report.mjs`)

You should see:

- **All files coverage summary**: Statements / Branches / Functions / Lines vs the threshold (current threshold is 90%)
- **Top missing branches / Top missing lines**: the weakest files (fix these first)
- **HTML report entry**: `coverage/index.html` for deeper drill-down

If the diagnostics say “no coverage output found”, tests likely failed before generating `coverage/`. Fix the test error first, then re-run.

## Cleaning up local artifacts (coverage / .tmp / dist / target)

Notes:
- Console logs are not written to disk unless you redirect output.
- The folders below are local build/test artifacts and are gitignored (they won’t be committed).

Common artifact folders:
- Coverage report: `coverage/` (HTML entry: `coverage/index.html`)
- E2E smoke artifacts: `.tmp/e2e/desktop-smoke/` (logs/screenshots)
- Frontend build output: `dist/`
- Rust build cache: `src-tauri/target/` (or any `target/`)

PowerShell (Windows):

`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force coverage,.tmp,dist -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`

(Optional) Rust cache:

`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force src-tauri/target -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`

macOS/Linux:

`rm -rf coverage .tmp dist`

(Optional) `rm -rf src-tauri/target`

Advanced (use with care): remove all untracked files (including ignored ones). Dry-run first:

`git clean -fdxn`

Then execute:

`git clean -fdx`

## Builtin command sources (must commit generated outputs)

If you change:
- `docs/command_sources/_*.md`
- `scripts/generate_builtin_commands.ps1`

You must regenerate and commit outputs:

`pwsh -File scripts/generate_builtin_commands.ps1`

`git add assets/runtime_templates/commands/builtin docs/builtin_commands.generated.md`

CI (Windows) will block PRs if generated outputs are not committed.

## Windows desktop E2E smoke (CI runs this)

CI runs:

`npm run e2e:desktop:smoke`

Artifacts are written to:

`.tmp/e2e/desktop-smoke/`

To run locally on Windows, install:

`cargo install tauri-driver --locked`

`pwsh -File scripts/e2e/install-msedgedriver.ps1`

You can also run a one-command local validation script:

`npm run verify:local`

On Windows, this command auto-detects missing `tauri-driver` / `msedgedriver` and installs them before running smoke tests.

If you want to force-install driver deps before running checks:

`npm run verify:local -- --install-webdriver`

For macOS, `verify:local` runs quality gate only by default (desktop smoke is disabled).  
If you want to probe experimental macOS desktop smoke manually:

`npm run verify:local -- --macos-desktop-e2e-experimental`

## Trigger and permission matrix

1) Local `commit` (with hooks enabled): runs `.githooks/pre-commit` -> `npm run precommit:guard` (incremental local gate).

2) Local one-command validation: run `npm run verify:local` (full gate + Windows desktop smoke; auto-installs missing WebDriver deps on Windows).

3) Push / PR to upstream:
- Push to `main` or PR targeting `main` triggers `CI Gate`.
- Push to a personal feature branch in upstream usually does not trigger `CI Gate` unless you open a PR to `main`.
- `CI Gate` currently includes: Windows quality gate, Windows desktop smoke, and cross-platform smoke (macOS/Linux build+test gate).

4) Tag push (`v*.*.*`): triggers release build/publish pipeline.

5) GitHub manual workflows (`workflow_dispatch`):
- In upstream repo, only users with write-level repository permission can trigger them.
- External contributors without write access cannot trigger upstream manual workflows.
- Contributors can run manual workflows in their own forks if enabled there.

## Working with a protected `main` branch

Branch protection only affects pushes/merges to `origin/main`. It does not prevent local commits on `main`, but it’s strongly recommended to keep local `main` clean and do all work on feature branches.

Recommended workflow:

1) Sync local `main`:

`git fetch origin`

`git switch main`

`git pull --rebase origin main`

2) Create a feature branch:

`git switch -c feat/<topic>`

3) Commit as usual, then push and open a PR:

`git push -u origin feat/<topic>`
